#Marcello Review:

1. "Trustworthiness" has a very specific meaning in the CPS framework. There is a TW aspect with various concerns. I thought you meant to focus on the TW aspect alone (vs. other aspects, such as Functional), but I see from the slides that the approach is completely general, in that tw_comp/2 is applied to all concerns. We should either focus the entire algorithm to trustworthiness or replace the current references to trustworthiness with something else. I believe "assurance" may be a good fit (look it up in the description of the CPS Framework published by NIST) -- Ed what do you think? (need to discuss)

2.The term is so overloaded that it may get confusing in the context of this paper. Perhaps we can call them "requirements", which is also used by NIST and is a term we have begun using more and more frequently. Or maybe "CPS property" or similar. (need to discuss)

3. At step 8, I am wondering if one should take into account the hierarchy of concerns and how one concern's satisfaction affects the satisfaction of its parent concern. (need to discuss)

4. Related to #3: the link between properties that hold and concerns that are satisfied is rather rich and not entirely straightforward. Some time ago, I defined three "reasoning modes", not unlike brave reasoning vs cautious reasoning. Perhaps it may make sense to include that in step 5. I think I sent you my description and formalization of the reasoning modes some time ago, but I am not 100% sure. I am happy to resend. We can also have a meeting where I can discuss them. (need to discuss Dr Son and Matthew)

5. The current description does not address links and interdependencies between components, or at least I didn't see them. So, in principle, it is irrelevant whether one applies the algorithm to a single component or to multiple ones. It may be worth thinking about that. (need to discuss with Dr Son and Matthew)
